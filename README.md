# Usage
First of all, you need to install `docker` and `docker-compose`. 
If your environment is Ubuntu, you can execute the `install_docker.sh` to install them, otherwise, you have to install them yourself.

When you have `docker`, you can execute the `run.sh` directly. 
The `run.sh` script will help you to start the server.

Finally, you can type the **IP address of the server with 8000 port** in any browser, and then you will see the beautiful user interface.
